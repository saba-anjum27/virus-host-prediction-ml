Viral Host Prediction using Machine Learning\

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the host of viruses based on their DNA sequences. We utilized machine learning and deep learning models to classify viruses into distinct host classes, including humans,plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, bacteria, eukaryotic microorganisms, archaea, and fungi.By accurately predicting viral host specificity, we can gain valuable insights into virus-host interactions, facilitate disease surveillance, and enhance our understanding of viral transmission patterns.The project's outcome can significantlycontribute to scientific research, public health, and environmental protection, making it a valuable asset to the academic community and society as a whole.

## Key Achievements
- Developed robust machine learning and deep learning models for accurate host classification.
- Preprocessed and analyzed genomic data from diverse sources.
- Achieved accurate classification into eight host classes.
- Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration for advancements in virology and precision medicine.
  
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Data Preprocessing
- Natural Language Processing
- Ensemble Methods
- Model Optimization
- Deep Learning
  
## Dataset
Our dataset was meticulously assembled from the ViralZone database, classifying viruses into eight primary host classes. We retrieved viral DNA sequences from these host classes through links on ViralZone, which led to the NCBI database. To ensure balanced training data, we selected 35 sequences from each class, forming an equally distributed dataset.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of approximately 82.14% in binary host classification using CNN.
- Successful classification into eight host classes.
- Valuable insights for public health and scientific research.
